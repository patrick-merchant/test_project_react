# Test Project

## Aims:

- To build a basic test project to assist in learning a new tech stack, after joining Atos' full-stack engineering team.
- The team has recommended exploring Golang, GraphQL and React.

## Test Project Spec Aims:

- Build a Go GraphQL API to mimic one endpoint from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. Use https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go
- Build a React frontend to display the data using https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/.

## Outcome:
This repo contains the React code for the test project. This frontend utilises a GraphQL API, found here: https://github.com/patrick-merchant/test_project_graphql. The API has full CRUD functionality, which this frontend utilises.

## Running the project:
- In this repo, run `npm install` and then `npm start` to install dependecies and run the development server.
- In the API repo, run `go run main.go` to run the API on localhost:8081.
